I sit and wait...
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know...
The places where we go when we gray and old

As I have been told
That the angels leave their wings unfold...
So when I'm lying in my bead
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead...
I'm loving angels instead.
